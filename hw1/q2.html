  <p>We swabbed Atticus's cheek and sent it off to get tested by <a href="http://www.wisdompanel.com" target="_blank">Wisdom Pannel</a>. His ancestry is listed here from strongest inheritance to weakest.</p>
  <ol>
      <li>Australian Shepherd</li>
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Shepherd"> The Australian Shepherd, often known simply as the "Aussie", is a medium-sized breed of dog that was, despite its name, developed on ranches in the Western United States, during the 19th century.</blockquote>
      <li>Australian Cattle Dog</li>
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Cattle_Dog"> The Australian Cattle Dog (ACD), or simply Cattle Dog, is a breed of herding dog originally developed in Australia for droving cattle over long distances across rough terrain. The Australian Cattle Dog is a medium-sized, short-coated dog that occurs in two main colour forms. It has either brown or black hair distributed fairly evenly through a white coat, which gives the appearance of a "red" or "blue" dog.</blockquote>
      <li>American Staffordshire Terrier</li>
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Staffordshire_Terrier"> The American Staffordshire Terrier, also known as Amstaff (in the United States) or simply Stafford, is a medium-sized, short-coated American dog breed. It is one of several breeds commonly known as pit bulls.[2][3] In the early part of the twentieth century the breed gained social stature and was accepted by the American Kennel Club in 1936.[4] The name was changed to reflect difference from the Staffordshire Bull Terrier of England.</blockquote>
      <li>Chinese Shar Pei</li>
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shar_Pei"> The Chinese Shar-Pei, is a breed of dog known for its distinctive features of deep wrinkles and a blue-black tongue. The breed originates from China. The English name (沙皮, pinyin: shā pí; probably derived from British spelling of the Cantonese equivalent, sā pèih), which translates to "sand skin" and refers to the texture of its short, rough coat. As puppies, Shar Pei have numerous wrinkles, but as they mature, these loosen and spread out as they "grow into their skin". Shar Pei were named in 1978 as one of the world's rarest dog breeds by TIME magazine and the Guinness World Records. Although the Shar Pei has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th century, the American Kennel Club did not recognize it as a breed until 1992.</blockquote>
